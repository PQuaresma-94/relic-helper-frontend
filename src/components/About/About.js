        As a passionate Star Wars fan and dedicated player of Star Wars: Galaxy
        of Heroes (SWGoH), my mission with this project is to empower players
        like myself with the tools and information they need to strategically
        upgrade their roster and unlock legendary characters. Whether you're
        just starting out or seeking to optimize your existing lineup, this
        platform offers valuable insights into resource management. By providing
        your current relic levels, you can efficiently plan your next farming
        endeavors. Moreover, authenticated users gain access to exclusive
        features, including the ability to create and manage custom squads
        tailored to their gameplay goals. Join our community today and embark on
        your journey to build the ultimate roster in the galaxy!
